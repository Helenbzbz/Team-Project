# Final Project Proposal

## The Big Idea

This project is a website to help users prioritzie tasks, keep tracks of things to do, long-term goals, how long they spent on long-term goals, and (if possible) visualize everyday schedule into a calendar. I will apply flask for this assignment. I wish I will be able to get all parts done and work on formatting and designing this websites. If I still have extra time, I will try to add more interactive elements in this website to motivate users to stick to their schedules. For example, I can add tokens to this website and allow users to set a dream lists with pre-set token price for each item they want.

## Learning Goals

I regard this project as a good practice of what I learnt in this class so far. The biggest goal is to use Python to turn my ideas into a useful website. By the end of the project, I wish I will learn some contents out of the courses, including UI/UX, how to save the content entered into the website somewhere else and return when the website is reopened,and how to visualize information in Python in a more user friendly manner.

## Implementation Plan & Project Schedule

I break down the project into the following tasks and allocate these tasks into the 3.5 weeks schedule.
Since I chose to work alone, there is no collaboration plan.

###### Week 1. 4.7~4.14
A. Write the codes for task list part
B. Write the codes for saving schedule part. This part need one function to automatically generate the 2 hours interval for next 7 days and allows user to enter things to do for those times.
C. Write the codes to calculate the total time used on a long-term goal. After clicking complete in the job list, the time will be added and saved.


###### Week 2. 4.14~4.21

A. Write codes of flaks to implement the above 3 functions/n
B. Improve UI/UX of the website


###### Week 3. 4.21~4.28
A. Improve the projects, preapre for demo session
B. Add encouraging system


The following 3 things I need to learn during this weekend before I can start to work on the project:
A. How to save inputs or data in a database so that next time when I open the website it still has the information I entered previously
B. How to organize the website design to make it more userfriendly
C. After clicking the button of 'Complete', how do I add the time for this task into the total time I spent in a corresponding category


## Risks

I considered this project as a little bit ambitious and I am unsure whether I can successfully visialize the things to do in a calender. Given we only have 3 weeks to finish this project, I will first finish the core function of the website, to do list, and then moves on to finish other function if possible.

## Additional Course Content

I think we will cover how to save data on website in the following classes? I think more materials about user interactive functions will be very helpful.
