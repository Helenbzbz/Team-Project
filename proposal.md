###### Final Project Proposal

## The Big Idea

This project is a website to help users prioritzie tasks, keep tracks of things to do, long-term goals, how long they spent on long-term goals, and (if possible) visualize everyday schedule into a calendar. I will apply flask for this assignment. I wish I will be able to get all parts done and work on formatting and designing this websites. If I still have extra time, I will try to add more interactive elements in this website to motivate users to stick to their schedules. For example, I can add tokens to this website and allow users to set a dream lists with pre-set token price for each item they want.
